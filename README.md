NGIN is an experimental game engine built with performance in mind. This project is a personal endeavor to understand
the intricacies of game engine design and to implement data-oriented techniques. While it's currently in its early
stages, NGIN aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for game development.

> :warning: **Disclaimer**: NGIN is primarily a hobby project and is not intended for production use.

## :dart: Goals

- **Performance**: Emphasize a cache-friendly, data-oriented design.
- **Custom Allocators**: Manage memory efficiently with custom allocation strategies.
- **ECS System**: Implement a custom-built Entity-Component-System.
- **Editor**: Create an intuitive game editor for easy development.
- **Serialization**: Enable serialization & deserialization of game worlds.

## :construction: Development Status

NGIN is currently in its early stages. While the foundation is being laid, there's a lot of exciting development on the
horizon.

## :gear: Building

As NGIN uses CMake for its build system, ensure you have it installed and set up properly. More instructions for
building and dependencies will be added as the project progresses.

## :memo: Notes

The focus of NGIN is to explore efficient game engine architecture techniques. While performance is a key goal, it's
also an opportunity to delve deep into various subsystems of game engines.

## :handshake: Contribution & Feedback

While NGIN is a personal project, feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome. Feel free to open issues
or submit pull requests!
